# unit-4-game

**What Project Does?**

The purpose of this project was to introduce us to jquery and basic Java Script functions. It built on what we have learned so far in the course including HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
Through various functions, each of the tiles generates a random number that is not known to the player while another random number is generated that is known.

Each time one of the tiles is pressed, the number assigned to that tile is added to your overall score which you can see edit in real time. After a series of clicks and finding out the numbers, you must try and match the score with the generated number.

If you match the score, you win and if you go over the score you lose.

**Why the Project is useful?**

It's useful because it touches on many of the basics with regards to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The skeleton of the website must work and it must make sense in relation to the game. CSS and Bootstrap was used to design the game space and make it presentable to the player, and finally Javascript ran the game logic.
